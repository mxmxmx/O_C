hardware files for o_C quad 16 bit CV generator/processor
============

### .fpd files 

- .fpd (= front panel express).
- .svg (= same thing, exported from frontDesign).
- /fpd_nearlyghost: .fpd, w/ graphics by nearly_ghost 

### schematic 

- rev 2.e 
- (rev 2.c, 2.d are basically identical)

### ... gerbers for:

- o_C main pcb
- SSD1306 / SH1106 OLED carrier pcb 

### layouts/graphics

- as far as panel layouts go, we'd recommend keeping it 'generic'. using labels is unlikely to convey much useful information, because the role of the various in- and outputs (naturally) varies quite a bit across the various 'apps':
